Revamped the language selection list found in the spin settings menu. The language selection interface has been streamlined into a single list that includes both base languages and their variants. This makes it easy to browse all of the options while keeping things accessible via first-letter navigation.
Reorganized the language file structure. Base languages such as English and Spanish are now stored in the normal folder. Variants of these languages, such as English/Angry, English/Happy, and English/Sad are placed in the variants folder under their respective language subfolders for better organization and scalability.
Made it so if the selected language file is missing, empty, or contains no valid translations, the app now automatically falls back to English instead of exiting. A warning message is shown once, and the selected language is reset to English in the saved settings to prevent future errors. If the fallback English file is also missing or invalid, a critical error will be displayed and the app will exit gracefully.
