Welcome to my simple to use wheel spinner!
This is a lightweight decision-making app designed for fun, randomness, or quick choices. Whether you're deciding what game to play, who goes first, or what to eat, this app spins a virtual wheel and gives you a randomized result using real-time spinning logic.

App Features
The ability to add Custom Wheels. Create your own wheels with as many choices as you want. Each wheel can be edited, renamed, or deleted anytime.
The ability to save all of your created wheels and spinning settings to a file. All of your wheels and spinning preferences are automatically saved to disk and restored on the next launch.
The ability to adjust various spinning settings. This includes sliders for spin speed, slowdown rate, tick count, and randomness—letting you fine-tune exactly how the wheel feels when it spins.

How to Use.
To get started, launch the app and add a new wheel by entering a name and your list of options. Once your wheels are created, choose “Spin Wheel, select the one you want, and let it spin!
If you’d like to tweak how the wheel behaves, head into “Spin Settings” to adjust the speed, slowdown, tick count, and randomness. Your wheels are automatically saved in data/wheels.dat, and your preferences and spin settings are stored in data/preffs.dat.
Have fun!
